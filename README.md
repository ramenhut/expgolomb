# Exponential Golomb Coder
Exponential Golomb codes conserve space for lower values at the expense of higher values. Thus, these codes are useful for functions with higher probabilities of low valued outputs. 

The smallest input symbol, 0, results in a single bit of output, but larger values may require up to 32 bits of storage space.
